    <li>I am a massive nerd. I'm into all things comic books, video games, movies, and recently picked up the hobby of collecting and listening to vinyl records.</li>
    <li>One day my fandom for Minnesota sports will pay off, but until then, I will continue to be a massive fan of the very mediocre sports teams in this market!</li>
    <li>I attended college at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, MI before coming back to the Twin Cities and graduating with a degree in Radio Broadcasting where I spent time at 93X and a local sports station in the Cities before taking a full time position in Northern Minnesota.</li>
